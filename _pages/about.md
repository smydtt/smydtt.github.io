Hi!

Welcome to my website.

I currently work as Associate Professor of Economics at [South Asian University](http://www.sau.int/), an international university established by an intergovernmental agreement between eight SAARC countries. 

I am a macroeconomist with more than two decades of experience in teaching, academic research and research supervision in leading universities of India. I have published my research in reputed international journals and presented my research in major international conferences around the world. In addition, I have successfully completed the supervision of four PhD scholars, three under my primary supervision and another under my co-supervision. 

I received my Ph.D. from [CESP, JNU](https://www.jnu.ac.in/sss/cesp) in 2011. My doctoral thesis, titled [Macrodynamics of Financing Investment: Applications of Lotka-Volterra Class of Models](https://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/handle/10603/16631) looked at the applications of Predator-Prey (Lotka-Volterra) class of models in the context of dynamic macroeconomic models. I taught for 11 years in the Department of Economics, [Shyam Lal (Evening) College, University of Delhi](https://shyamlale.du.ac.in/) before joining the [Faculty of Economics, South Asian University](https://sau.int/faculty-of-economics-fe/) in 2012.
